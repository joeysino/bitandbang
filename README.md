It's me, Joey!

I forked https://github.com/bnb/bitandbang

# Usage

# Make your own

1. Fork
2. Clone
3. Edit `bin/card.js` and put your details
4. Open `package.json` and change `name`, `description`, `bin`, `repository` and `author` fields
   (Note that in the `repository` field you probablly need to change `bnb`, not `bitandbang`)
5. Commit and push your changes (optional)
6. Run `npm pack` to build a tgz so you can preview what you are about to publish
